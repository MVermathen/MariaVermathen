    <!--    <p>Maps are tools of power. Wars and struggles over geography are not only fought on the ground but also through representations and maps (see SAID). This means they can also be used to counter oppressions and silencing. <br> 
      During my studies in urban geography I have had the occasion to make maps in many different shapes showing a diverse range of relations and productions of space. During my internship at the LPED, I participated in creating data bases and maps of evacautions in Marseille as a result of <em>mises en péril</em>. These maps were published in several articles by E. Dorier and J. Dario. <br>
    For my Master's thesis, I represented sex workers' spaces of solidarity, support, but also discrimination, surveillance and marginalisation through a map entitled <b>PLANET MARS</b>. The material I used to make the map were all texts, illustrations, laws, flyers, posters, books and pamphlets that are part of the sex work-cityscape of Marseille. For the background, I used law texts and newspaper articles that commonly depict sex workers through stereotypes and classifications such as "<em>travesti</em>" and origin. They never include sex workers' voices. Material for the "revanchist city" were leaflets informing about new security strategies in the city that deploy more police and an abolitionist manifesto. Support structures form the central part of the map, for which various flyers with information for sex workers, posters for festivals, and books written by sex workers were used. On Planet Mars, many represented structures are underground and therefore, nothing is geolocalised. However, the positions correspond to a distorted, yet real geography of the city, showing that what is supposed to be marginal, illegal and invisible is actually in the heart of the city.</p>
