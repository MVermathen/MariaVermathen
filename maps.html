    <h1>Maps</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Maps are tools of power. This means they can also be used to counter oppressions and silencing. <br> 
      During my studies in urban geography I have had the occasion to make maps in many different shapes showing a diverse range of relations and productions of space. During my internship at the LPED, I had the opportunity to participate in creating data bases and maps of evacautions in Marseille as a result of <em>mises en p√©ril</em>. These maps were published in several articles by E. Dorier and J. Dario.</p>
