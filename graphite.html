    <h1>GRAPHITE - Les jeunes et la ville</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>GRAPHITE is an action research project that aims at combining research with education. Through a partnership between the research laboratory Laboratoire Population Environnement Développement (LPED), located at Université Aix-Marseille, and different highschools in Marseille and other cities of the département, highschools students create urban planning projects as groups over the period of one school semester. These projects focus on spaces that the students know well and centre the needs and views of young people, many of whom live social housing neighbourhoods in Marseille. During the semester, the students map their perspective of the city; from places they like to places they avoid or would like to change. At the end of the school year, each group finalises their project and presents it on a poster and, in most cases, in a short video. The presentation takes place at the Université Aix-Marseille in front of other participating classes, journalists and local politicians. Through the mapping activity, data is collected on the city from the point of view of people whose voices are not often heard. This data is analysed at the LPED from where research on the topic is published. </p>
